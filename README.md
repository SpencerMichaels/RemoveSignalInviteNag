# Signal invite nag remover (Xposed module)

[Signal](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android) is a secure,
open-source messaging app for Android and iOS. It's an excellent app, but it has
an unfortunate un-feature that displays an "Invite this person to Signal!" nag
popup every time you start a conversation with a new contact. This is a simple
Xposed module that removes the nag.
